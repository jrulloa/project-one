    Proposed Research Questions
    What is the relationship between the price of gasoline and consumer spending for durable goods, non-durable goods and services?


    Proposed Hypotheses
    Null: We hypothesize that there will be a not be a negative relationship between the price of the gasoline and the amount of money spent on consumer consumptions in the durable, non-durable and services categories.
    
    Alternative: We hypothesize that there will  be a negative relationship between the price of the gasoline and the amount of money spent on consumer consumptions in the durable, non-durable and services categories. 

    Project Description/Outline
    In this project, we will analyze different datasets to determine if there is a correlation between the change in oil prices and consumer consumption across three main categories: durable, non-durable and services categories. We will determine what the correlation is and determine if the relationship is positive or negative for each category. We will also run different statistical analysis to get to the bottom of our research question.  

    In order to do so, we plan on utilizing certain tools such as Python and its libraries, Matplotlib to visualize our statistical analysis and API to easily access datasets from different companies’ websites.
    We plan on looking at datasets across a total of ten states (five states with the highest per capita income and 5 states with the lower per capita income). We also plan to look at the GDP per state to help us draw any conclusions on consumers residing in the states of interest.

    Datasets to be Used 
    Oil Price per state: https://www.eia.gov/opendata/qb.php?category=241529 
    Consumer Consumption:https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=70&step=1&acrdn=7#reqid=70&step=1&acrdn=7 
    Personal Income per state: https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=70&step=1&acrdn=8
    GDP per state: https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gdp-state

    Rough Breakdown of Tasks
    Work was equally spread out.
